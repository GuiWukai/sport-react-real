# *what it does*:
echosport is a web application powered by Astuce Media, where the user can filter the database of NBA players by a number of their status. Upon clicking on the plus button on the right-hand side, the tuple expands down and the user can see the Basketball player, his stats per game and stats per season, updated in real time.

# *to use this application*:
You can find our website [here](echo-sport.firebaseapp.com/).  

Otherwise, you can head on over to <code> guccicheese </code> directory, clone the repository and run the dependencies as instructed on the README there.

This is the database of NBA players in the current season, updated in real time. 

Click on the **plus** sign on the right hand side to each tuple to drop down the data visualization of the player statistics and their photo!
